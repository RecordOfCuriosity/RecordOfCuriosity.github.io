Everyone wants to talk about how its “all” about gratitude. But its easy to be grateful when things are going good. But what really matters is when your in a bad mood and your patience is being tested. Could you in that moment go from that negative state to a positive state of gratitude. This is where the magic happens. Especially if your are in one of those seasons of struggle when life has you in the corner and is really teeing off on your trying to knock you out. Can you maintain your wits about you and be grateful.

How do you do it?

When your pissed, your pissed. How do you change your negative state to a positive one?

It seems impossible when your mad.

Trust me we have all been there.

But the secret to changing your state willfully is controlling the one thing you can.

Your thoughts.

That’s it.

If you were to compare changing states to turning the light on or off.

The action of reaching out and flicking that switch would be the equivalent of you thinking.

Thats the simplified version.

But you would be a fool to think that's all there is to it.

If being grateful is the key to all good there is in life, how could you obtain this key so easily and effortlessly?

However thats all there is to it…

But heres the catch you were waiting for.

The action of thinking to change your state is a skill.

Also the states are not simply on or off as well. 

There is a wide variety and to go from one state to the next there.

Ok let’s stop the fronting

When I began writing this I was irritated and moody. I was increasingly getting more pissed throughout the day. I kept getting in these self inflicted genjutsus where I think of something that never happened and absorb the negative emotions of that incident that could of happened or that might happen in the future but in reality never did happen.

So me writing that was more of a coping mechanism or you can think of it of a way getting through it.

But my intention was polluted with my brand and trying to teach people. I had a holier than thou tone when in reality I’m not that guy right now. I still had that shadow of negativity looming over me while preaching gratitude and how easy it is to change your state and be a master of your own will.

Really that’s what I’ve been hearing and reading but I still haven’t lived through it and really assimilated these ideas.

A lot of that change of state writing I kept thinking of Tony Robbins convo with Gary Vee about gratitude and Nouman Ali Khans explanation of a certain verse in the Quran that talks about gratitude.

The writings before the descending dots was not me documenting my true experience. Merely trying to explain other peoples explanations without making it worth for myself.

I started bubbling up in anger then I went to the washroom where I can be in isolation.

Then I stopped thinking for a second and became aware of my tension and negativity.

Once I was aware then I thought to myself. This is where I want to be. This is what I have to embrace. This is where the growth happens.

I was able to take a step back and not be so focused and caught up with how much the negativity sucked and feeling bad about being negative.

And step back and really see that this is where my mental fortitude is being strengthened.

That awareness and change of perspective immediately cooled me down. Like I took a hit of some menthol vape.

Not all the way cooled down.

But a slight, comfortable amount.

You know what it’s like.

Doing a plank or bench press.

Think to the state you were feeling that burn when your about to give out.

You have the perspective that the longer you are able to hold out and really embracing the pain. The more muscle and strength you will gain afterwards.

But when your feeling like shit and your angry.

Your not intentionally doing that, especially when your stuck in these negative genjutsu loops.

So it’s like randomly being thrown into that last few second of a tough workout. But not knowing why or how to get out.


Idk man

I feel like this is the direction I need to embrace.

That being aware of the negativity, having that workout perspective and then embrace it.

This feels a lot better than trying to be perfect. Maybe when I make gains in the future and I am able to package it up and share it to people.

But let’s be raw and document the true come up.

From weak to strong.
