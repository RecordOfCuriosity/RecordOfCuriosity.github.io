I’ve been here before…

Im in a limbo state again. I am not moving towards anything and I have no direction to even begin looking at. This is a very familiar state that I am in. The grandiose visions and tales of the past are just that. Of the past. 

Alhamdulillah.

Thank god that I am content and at peace. Even though I am currently not it a position that I dream to be in I am still grateful and carry no burden of negativity. 

That means I am currently in a loop.

Let’s embark on a journey of understanding. A quest to discover the essence of this loop that I am so clearly in. 

Lets begin with defining what I mean by a loop.

Is it a thing, or maybe an experience? Is it a transitionary period sandwiched between two phases of life that everytime I try to ascend to the next phase I fail and fall back into this limbo period between the old phase and the new?

I like the sound of that hahahahaha. It’s noble and fits into my personal narrative of my life being an adventure.

But I’m not looking for self-amusement. I am looking for the truth.

That requires for me to unload my biases, and emotions.

Lets start with describing my current state.

I am unchained with no direction. Complete freedom. That’s terrifying now that I think about it. Freedom without me applying bounds means that someone will come along and apply their own bounds. Like a wild horse. The difference between man and the wild horse is that man can tame himself with the permission of Allah.

Wow.

Just before I began to write these musings in my state of “freedom” I was looking through my digital library. What was I doing in my state of heedlessness? Unconsciously I was searching for an external source to provide these bounds or inspire a direction.


On a side note…

In the past when I found myself returning to this state I would be enveloped with negativity such as discontent. Alhamdulilah this is something new. For me to exist in this state again but with a lighter burden than the previous times.

I am hopeful and optimistic for the future.

This current existence in the limbo state is a proof of progression.

….


I am still heavily biased and stuck on my previous description of this loop being a transitionary period.

There are clear benefits to this definition because it gives me grounds to stand
