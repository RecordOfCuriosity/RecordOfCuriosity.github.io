title: Accepting Blame and a Call to Adventure
description: There are three traits to explore and a box to unpackage.

I don’t know if it's always been this way, but I have found myself not able to take any blame. Especially from one particular person. It’s probably no surprise that I accepted a huge promise, trust, and responsibility from that person last May.

As of late, I have been catching myself when blamed, getting agitated and extremely defensive. It’s almost everyday so its been very noticeable. The funny thing is that I can catch when other people make excuses or show any time of victimhood. When I see these things in people I judge them and their ratings drop in my eyes.

Jokes on me.

I always had a feeling that maybe this criticism of excuses/victimhood is actually a character trait that I have and that's why I judge people of it so harshly.

I knew I had a tendency to make excuses but I didn’t claim it as a problem I had.

Denial.

The dust I have been sweeping under the rug has started to pile up until it's right in my face.

Literally today. I made a mistake that I should have manned up and taken responsibility for. However, I found myself getting defensive and upset with the blood rushing to my head.

It's clear now there are flaws that I have been unwilling to address.

Excuses. Everything that causes this action and everything that is caused by this action needs to be explored. That symptom is clear and has become increasingly more malignant like a cancer cell.

I was going to write earlier that I had a victim mentality, but something within me deep in the unconscious rejected it. Immediately thoughts of justification emerged to make a case that this feeling of rejection is true/good/accepted. Thoughts such as “That doesn’t sound like me”.

That's probably a sign.

I have had major and minor successes in my life. I do believe that I am capable and able to achieve great things in life. I also do believe I am destined to achieve them. Or that belief might be a delusional entitlement..

But I am aware that currently, I am far from great and only a stone's throw away from being a loser.

Alhamdulillah for this awareness of the following three things.

1. My inability to accept blame and my reaction when blamed

2. Excuses
   
3. Victim Like Mentality
   
I want to explore these three things and document my raw journey as I do so. That seems like the direction to go.
Embrace the friction.



P.S.

As I was reading over and slightly editing this post. I reflected on when I wanted to reject the idea of being a victim and the mechanisms that were involved in that.

It started with something within me rejecting it. It was like something being unveiled within me.

That is interesting within itself and I intend to explore what that is.

If it's my self, or soul, or mind, or some archive of consciousness that I am tapping into.

Also.

Immediately following that ‘feeling’ thoughts came forth to support it.

This is what was interesting when I reflected back on this event.

Two types of thoughts came forth as support.

One of clear justification. It was the statement I mentioned earlier “ That doesn’t sound like me”

This was the first thought and the first type, a clear justification as to why it was ok for me to feel uneasy when I rejected the idea of being a victim.

The second type of thought came immediately right after.

This thought was like a box that needed to be unpackaged.

It was a suggestion that my justification was true due to my past experiences. Also, it came with an understanding that verification of that suggestion is needed and that is a journey that must be embarked on.

Basically the second type of thought was a prompt for a journey. This is a journey to the inner world of consciousness and unconsciousness.

However, it is problematic that I knew this journey required effort so this suggestion became an assumption.

This is probably hard to follow lol.

Nevertheless, it's an idea and observation that I intend to explore later.

Wrap it all up in a black box.

Inshallah, later on when I dive into Psychology, Consciousness, and the works of Carl Jung I will explore these types of ideas/adventures.

For now.

1. My inability to accept blame and my reaction when blamed

2. Excuses

3. Victim Like Mentality
