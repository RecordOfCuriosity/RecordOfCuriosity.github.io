Secrets of The Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker
Summary & Commentary by ROC

July 12, 2023

Part 0: Introduction

Summary
The author begins with explaining his credibility and the intent behind this book. The goal of this book is to make you unlearn your previous paradigm on financial success and to reprogram your mind to think like a millionaire. 

The author started out as a loser living in his parents basement, suffering with delusions pertaining to his potential. He has tried to become successful but has failed multiple times and is in this phase of his life where many don’t transition through from being poor or normal to becoming successful. 

The author then details a story where one of his fathers friends who has achieved financial success takes pity on the struggling young man and gives him life-changing advice. He first lays the foundation saying that all people who are financially successful think the same or share the same paradigm. If you are not successful the hard truth is that you do not think the same as the wealthy. 

After laying this foundation the wealthy friend of his father shares a passing principle that all wealthy people share. The principle being that wealthy people honor their commitments. When they make one they follow it.

Armed with this new principle and paradigm the author opens up a fitness retail store and commits to it fully until it becomes his first financial success opening up multiple chains making his breakthrough into millionaire status.

Then the author states he took some time off to make a blueprint of financial success then he began coaching other people to also help them be as wealthy as him. After successfully teaching countless people he compiled his blueprint into this book.

He concluded the brief introduction with a story where the main takeaway is that you will ask for help and when help comes you look for another solution. Stop looking left and right since this book is the solution. Empty your mind and digest this book and you will see results.

Quotes

“PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED, AT THE BEGINNING OF MY seminars, when one of the first things I tell them is “Don’t believe a word I say.” Why would I suggest that? Because I can only speak from my own experience. None of the concepts and insights I share are inherently true or false, right or wrong. They simply reflect my own results, and the amazing results I’ve seen in the lives of thousands and thousands of my students.”

“...if you’re not doing as well as you’d like, all that means is there’s something you don’t know.”

“...rich people keep their commitments…”

“It is essential you recognize how your old ways of thinking and acting have gotten you exactly where you are right now.”

“The lesson is simple. If you want to move to a higher level of life, you have to be willing to let go of some of your old ways of thinking and being and adopt new ones. The results will eventually speak for themselves.”

Commentary

Personally I can relate to the author, its as if the author is vividly painting a picture of exactly what I am going through. I have embarked on countless jou rney’s to become successful even leaving my home for 6 months but I end up stuck and back to the beginning.
A negative thought that came up while I was reading the first half of the introduction was that I don’t want to commit to becoming wealthy there are more important things in life. I don't want to obsess and invest all my life into money. The reality is that life isn’t about wealthy and I understand my purpose is to worship Allah and our time in this dunya is temporary. I need to balance my Akhira and becoming wealthy. There are 4 sahabah who were insanely wealthy but they were still guaranteed Jannah while still living. So there is a balance I have to understand and come to terms with. This is a major obstacle in my line of thinking.




Part One: Your Money Blueprint

Principles
Your Income Can Only Grow to the Extent You Do!



Summary
The author begins by laying out a pattern he has recognized of duality. Hot/Cold, Up/Down, Good/Evil, Left/Right … etc. 

This pattern can be observed in financial success as well. The duality is the inner and outer game of money. The outer is the techniques like marketing and sales, investing which allow you to amass wealth. But just as important is the inner game. What goes on in your head, your beliefs about money. 

Who are you? What are you habits? Your current state? What do you do when things get difficult, when you lose motivation, when you are uncomfortable?

Quotes
“...there are “outer” laws of money, there must be “inner” laws. The outer laws include things like business knowledge, money management, and investment strategies. These are essential. But the inner game is just as important. An analogy would be a carpenter and his tools. Having top-of-the-line tools is imperative, but being the top-notch carpenter who masterfully uses those tools is even more critical.”

“It’s not enough to be in the right place at the right time. You have to be the right person in the right place at the right time.”

“So who are you? How do you think? What are your beliefs? What are your habits and traits? How do you really feel about yourself? How confident are you in yourself? How well do you relate to others? How much do you trust others? Do you truly feel that you deserve wealth? What is your ability to act in spite of fear, in spite of worry, in spite of inconvenience, in spite of discomfort? Can you act when you’re not in the mood?”


“The key to success is to raise your own energy; when you do, people will naturally be attracted to you. And when they show up, bill ’em!”

“...what is under the ground creates what is above the ground, where what is invisible creates what is visible.”






Commentary
I don’t want to be engrossed and obsessed with making money until all my time is being spent doing that. My father was a person who spent majority of his life working for money and I don’t want to do that.




Priority List
Clearly layout all your commitments and then start fulfilling them. With this you will begin to understand the heavinesses of the burden named commitment. You will be more careful in your selection of commitments but more truthful as a whole.

I am fearful of this. My entire being is screaming to procrastinate this. The excuse I gave myself is that when I finish this book I will understand how to go about doing things and that this book will clear any obstacle in my path of completing this herculean task. The obstacles I refer to are all mental. Objections, doubts, fears and delusions. Success is with Allah first and foremost and I seek his bounty through the medium of this book.
