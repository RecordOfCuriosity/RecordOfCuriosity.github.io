Work Expands to Fill the Time Allocated for It

This concept is the reason for your procrastination and lack of progression.

I spent a couple of hours rewinding the video and writing to digest this one idea.

Once I understood it, I realized that I was suffering from the same problem..
Here is how this problem is affecting you:

You need to think of work as a living, breathing entity.

If you don’t restrict your time for work, then it will continue to expand.

There are two major issues with this.

Procrastination and Stagnation


1.) Procrastination

Because there are no time limits for your work.

It grows until it becomes too large of a burden for you to bear.

The work will become too much to handle causing you to avoid it and procrastinate.

You have to consciously restrict work to a block of time that you can handle.

This allows you to consistently get the work done every day and build momentum.


2.) Stagnation

If you don’t restrict your work to a block of time, you will never give yourself a chance to innovate and level up.

This is a trap everybody falls for.

When people want different results their logic is to increase the amount of work they do.

However, when your work is limited to a set block of time.

Naturally, you will find yourself innovating and evolving the work itself to get more results.

Limiting the time for work creates an environment for growth and evolution.
