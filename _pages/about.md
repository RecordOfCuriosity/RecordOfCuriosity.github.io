# My Philosophy

Understand and develop yourself,

understand the reason for the existence of life and this world,

and enjoy the fruits of that which you have put effort to cultivate. 

Such as peak athletic fitness, meaningful relationships, beneficial knowledge, and an abundance of wealth.

# Journey

My main goal right now is to find a career as a blockchain and web3 developer. I need to find a new career right away and change my current work-life conditions.

My second goal is to build my brand, Record of Curiosity. I will document my journey and share the things I learned. My main platforms will be Twitter, YouTube, and my Blog.

My third goal is fitness-based. I want to rebuild my athleticism and develop an aesthetic physique.

## Fitness Goal

I have been going to the gym for about 4 months now.
My first two months were hyper-consistent and the last 2 were super sporadic.

I was following a program but then when changes needed to be made to fit my evolving needs I didn’t make those changes which caused a severe decline in the discipline surrounding fitness.

The goal is to rebuild my athletic foundation (kneesovertoes) and to focus on certain lacking body parts that I am insecure over. Chest, arms, and abs for aesthetics. Posterior chain and upperback/shoulders for athletics.

A - Kneesovertoes / Chest
B - Upperback-shoulders / Abs
C - Posterior chain / Arms

If I can only do one set consistently it would be my A set without a doubt. 

A>B>C

If those three sets were to be mastered or focused on over the next 6 months I’ll be extremely satisfied. The details I can work out but my macro focus has been set for now.

Athletic Foundation > Aesthetics
